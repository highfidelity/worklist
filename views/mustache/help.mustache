        <h4>What is Worklist?</h4>
        <p>
          Worklist is High Fidelity's job tracker and marketplace for software development. We use it to supplement our
          <strong><a href='http://highfidelity.io'>internal team</a></strong>.<br/> <br/>

        <h4>I'm a web programmer, will I be able to find work here?</h4>
        <p>
          We have both PHP/MySQL (<strong><a href='https://www.worklist.net/worklist'>Worklist</a></strong>) and Ruby/Postgres/Redis
          (<strong><a href='https://www.highfidelity.io'>High Fidelity</a></strong>) projects. We are often looking for good
          front-end web developers with a keen eye for detail. More web-based projects will be coming as High Fidelity grows.
          We also have a growing need for JavaScript developers who are open to learning
          <strong><a href='https://github.com/highfidelity/hifi/wiki/Javascript-API'>Hifi JavaScript</a></strong>.
        </p>

        <h4>I'm a C++ programmer, will I be able to find work here?</h4>
        <p>
          Absolutely. High Fidelity is cross-platform and contains myriad components, most written in C++ with heavy utilization
          of Qt. In particular, we have a growing need for developers on Windows.

      <section id="gf4">
        <h4>Why do I need a GitHub account?</h4>
        <p>
          Worklist is completely federated with GitHub.  We require write access on repositories in order to create branches
          and pull requests from Worklist; for example, when you receive a bid acceptance on a Job, a branch is created on
          your GitHub account under the Job's ticket number. Later in the process, when you change the status of a Job
          on Worklist to "Code Review," a pull request is automatically created from the Job's branch.
          Even private repo access is necessary as some of the code in the High Fidelity architecture is not public.
        </p>

      <section id="gf5">
        <h4>What is a Job?</h4>
        <p>
          A Job can be a feature, a bug, or any development (or otherwise) related task. Most Jobs will be software development
          related, but some could be about sound design or content development or younameit &mdash; Worklist is intended to be malleable,
          adapting as High Fidelity's needs change.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="gf6">
        <h4>What is the difference between a Developer and a Designer?</h4>
        <p>
          Developer refers to the person performing the actual work on a Job.  The Designer is the Job Manager.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="gf7">
        <h4>What is a Bid?</h4>
        <p>
          A bid is a Developer's proposal to perform work on a Job.  Bids consist of 1) the amount you would like to be paid,
          2) the approach you will take to complete the work needed to resolve the Job, 3) the amount of time that it will take
          to complete the work, and 4) how long you want the bid to remain active &mdash; the maximum time and our default is 7 days.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you enter a bid, it is always better to give a brief, yet detailed, description of how you intend to address
          the Job requirements. Designers are not just looking for the lowest bid; we are looking for a considered bid that has
          some thought behind it while not being unrealistic in cost.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="gf8">
        <h4>What is a Fee?</h4>
        <p>
          In addition to the initial bid, you will probably also see one or more fees attached to
          a Job. During the course of a Job, fees are added for code reviews (automatically calculated
          for most projects), testing or other help. We encourage Developers to use their best judgment
          when fee'ing in.

        <h4>How can I locate Jobs to Bid?</h4>
        <p>
          Go to our <strong><a href='./jobs'>Jobs page</a></strong> and select "Bidding" from the status drop down. This will show
          you a list of all currently open Jobs.</strong>
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="df4">
        <h4>What is the workflow of a Job?</h4>
        <p>
          Jobs on Worklist go through various statuses from preparation through release. Once your bid is accepted,
          you might find this cheat sheet helpful until you get the knack of our workflow.
        </p>
        <h5>Stage One: Preparation &gt; Job Setup</h5>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Suggestion -</strong> Worklist allows anyone to make suggestions for improvements to any active project. When
          Suggestion Jobs are added, Designers are notified via email and they decide whether or not to move them into Bidding.</br>
          Sometimes when a Developer has a suggestion, they will also have a particular solution
          in mind and be willing to do the work. Once a Developer adds a Suggestion Job, they have the ability to add a bid which in
          turn changes the status to Bidding.  Designers are again notified and make the final decision on whether or not to go
          ahead with the Job.</li>
          <li><strong>Pass -</strong> If for some reason a Designer decides not to move a Job into Bidding, they will set the
          Job to Pass.  Jobs in Suggestion are also auto-passed once they age 30 days.</li>
          <li><strong>Bidding -</strong> Once a Job is set to Bidding by a Designer, any Developer can put in their offer.
          Designers will review bids and accept based upon the best match to the Job requirements.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Stage Two: In Progress &gt; Getting Jobs Done</h5>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>In Progress -</strong> Once a bid has been accepted, the Job will automatically set to In Progress status. It will remain
          there until the Developer is done with the work.</li>
          <li><strong>QA Ready -</strong> When the Developer is ready for their work to be functionally tested, they will commit the
          changes to their branch (no Pull Request at this point)  and set the Job to QA Ready. At this step in the process, the
          Designer will test the functionality in the Developer's sandbox and then either ask for modifications or indicate their approval
          to move to Code Review.  Setting the Job to Code Review will automatically generate a Pull Request(PR) in GitHub.</li>
          <li><strong>Code Review -</strong> Code Review means the new code is ready to be reviewed by another Developer. If the reviewer
          finds any problems, they are either worked out in real-time in our <a href='http://gitter.im/highfidelity/worklist' target='_blank'>Gitter</a>
          or via comments added to the Job ticket. Once all requirements have been fulfilled, the Developer commits the code, verifies that
          the changes have been merged into the live repository and sets then sets the Job to Merged.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Stage Three: Finished &gt; Your Job is Done</h5>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Merged -</strong> Once your Job is merged into the GitHub Master Repository, the Developer sets the Job to
          Merged. The Job Designer will again be notified via email. This stage allows Designers additional time once the Job is
          live to verify the new functionality in production. If all is good, they will move the Job to the final status: Done!</li>
          <li><strong>Done -</strong> The Developer will not be paid until the Job is moved into Done status. Done Jobs will be picked
          up in our payment system during the next payment run via Paypal, currently twice a week.</li>
          </p>
        </ul>

      <section id="df5">
        <h4>What is a reasonable bid amount?</h4>
        <p>
          A bid is simply defined as the amount of money you will ask for completing the task described by a Job write up. You can browse
          through Done Jobs to get a good idea of what others have charged for similar Jobs. When considering a Job, be sure to carefully
          think about any problem areas or potential extra work before placing your bid, as your bid is considered an agreement between you and
          Worklist for any given Job.</strong>
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="df6">
        <h4>Can I view the source code and/or download it to my own server?</h4>
        <p>
          Yes! Our two main repositories, High Fidelity and Worklist <strong><a href="https://github.com/highfidelity">are housed on GitHub</a></strong>. The repositories are public and you can browse
          the code there.  You can read more on the GitHub process in our
          <strong><a href="https://github.com/highfidelity/worklist/wiki/Using-GitHub-with-the-Worklist-Project">Worklist wiki</a></strong>.

      </section>
      <section id="df7">
        <h4>I tried to bid on a Job and it said I am not eligible to bid, what's wrong?</h4>
        <p>
          Before you can place a bid, you need to set up your payment information in your <strong><a href='./settings'>profile settings</a></strong>. You need to both add your Paypal address and,
          if you're in the US, you will need to upload your W9 for our verification.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="df8">
        <h4>After I have completed my work, how do I get paid?</h4>
        <p>
          Once you've finished work and it has had a functional and code review completed, you should set the Job to Merged.
          The project Designer will then need to verify it works in production and will then set the Job to Done. You will not get paid until this
          happens. Please view the <strong><a href ="ff6">Project Status</a></strong> flow for more information.  All payments are
          currently handled through Paypal. When you create your worklist account, you'll be asked to supply your Paypal email address. We will pay as
          quickly as possible after a Job is marked Done in the worklist (this is done by the person who created or is the Designer for the Job).</strong>
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="df9">
        <h4>Who is eligible to perform code reviews?  How do I become eligible? </h4>
        <p>
          The right to code review is a special privilage granted by project admins. Ask <strong><a href="https://worklist.net/user/kordero">@kordero</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://worklist.net/user/joanneci">@joanneci</a></strong> or <strong><a href="https://worklist.net/user/problem">@problem</a></strong> if you think you're ready to watch over our Worklist code. Ask <strong><a href="https://worklist.net/user/birarda">@birarda</a></strong> or <strong><a href="https://worklist.net/user/problem">@problem</a></strong> if you feel your ready to review High Fidelity code.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you meet the Code Review qualifications (essentially, we just want to be able to trust you), you will be able to start a code review by clicking the Start Code Review
          button within a task.  If not, a hover message will appear over the button stating that "You are not Authorized to Code Review
          this Job".
